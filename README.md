# Using ARIMA to Forecast Egg Prices 

A project aimed to analyze the time series of egg prices by first detrending the data to remove any long-term trends, then deseasonalizing it to remove any seasonal cycles, and finally fitting an ARMA model to capture any remaining autocorrelation and moving average patterns in the data.

By doing so, we sought to gain insights into the cyclical patterns of egg prices and to develop a model that could be used to forecast future prices. The results of the analysis could be useful for stakeholders in the egg industry, such as producers, distributors, and consumers, in making informed decisions about pricing and supply chain management.
